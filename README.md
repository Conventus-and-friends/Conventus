## About
Conventus is an open source forum software, written in C# and Vue.js. It comes with an intuitive user interface and stands for stability and security.

## Why?
We spent a long time looking for a forum software that met all our requirements. However, we did not find what we were looking for. The idea for Conventus was born.
